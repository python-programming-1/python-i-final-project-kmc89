# Monte Carlo Simulation for Atomic Lattice

This program is using the Monte Carlo method to simulate the atom behavior at a certain concentration and temperature.
The atom 'A' is the base matrix and the atom 'B' is the doping element.
First, you should give a lattice size within 20-by-20, then input the concentration of the 'B' atoms.
The temperature used in this simulation also should be determined at first place followed by setting steps.

For the results, the first plot is the original distribution of atoms 'A' and 'B'.
the second one is the distribution after Monte Carlo Simulation
the third figure is the energy changes throughout those process.eworks.
